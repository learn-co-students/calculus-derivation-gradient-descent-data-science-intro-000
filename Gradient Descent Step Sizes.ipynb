Armed with a number that describes \"goodness of fit\", we can then begin to iteratively try new regression lines by adjusting our y-intercept value, $b$, or slope value, $m$, and assessing goodness of fit.  By finding the values $m$ and $b$ that minimize the RSS, we can find our \"best fit line\".
